# SAS Data Science

## Overview

This repository contains SAS code snippets for data science tasks and analyses. The code provided here serves as examples and templates for various data manipulation, analysis, and visualization tasks using SAS.

## Contents

CharactersData.sas: This file contains SAS code for creating a dataset named "characters" with manually entered data. The dataset includes information about fictional characters such as their name, gender, height, and weight.

## SAS Data Processing Example: "employees" Dataset

This SAS code snippet demonstrates the creation of a dataset named "employees" containing information about employees. The dataset has four variables:

1. **name**: Represents the name of the employee.
2. **gender**: Indicates the gender of the employee (M for male, F for female).
3. **age**: Represents the age of the employee.
4. **weight**: Indicates the weight of the employee.

The data is read from the "cards" section using the INFILE statement with a specified delimiter (`,`). Each line in the "cards" section represents information about an employee, including their name, gender, age, and weight.

The resulting dataset provides a structured representation of employees' demographic information, which can be further analyzed or used for statistical modeling and visualization tasks in SAS.

## Usage
