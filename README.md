# SAS Data Science

## Overview

This repository contains SAS code snippets for data science tasks and analyses. The code provided here serves as examples and templates for various data manipulation, analysis, and visualization tasks using SAS.

## SAS Data Processing Example: "characters" Dataset

This SAS code snippet demonstrates the creation of a dataset named "characters" containing information about fictional characters. The dataset has four variables:

1. **name**: Represents the name of the character.
2. **gender**: Indicates the gender of the character (M for male, F for female).
3. **height**: Represents the height of the character.
4. **weight**: Indicates the weight of the character.

The data is manually entered using the `cards` section, where each line represents information about a character, including their name, gender, height, and weight.

## SAS Data Processing Example: "employees" Dataset

This SAS code snippet demonstrates the creation of a dataset named "employees" containing information about employees. The dataset has four variables:

1. **name**: Represents the name of the employee.
2. **gender**: Indicates the gender of the employee (M for male, F for female).
3. **age**: Represents the age of the employee.
4. **weight**: Indicates the weight of the employee.

The data is read from the "cards" section using the INFILE statement with a specified delimiter (`,`). Each line in the "cards" section represents information about an employee, including their name, gender, age, and weight.

The resulting dataset provides a structured representation of employees' demographic information, which can be further analyzed or used for statistical modeling and visualization tasks in SAS.

## SAS Data Processing Example: "guardians" Dataset

This SAS code snippet demonstrates the creation of a dataset named "guardians" containing information about guardians. The dataset has three variables:

1. **first_name**: Represents the first name of the guardian.
2. **last_name**: Indicates the last name of the guardian.
3. **height**: Represents the height of the guardian.

The data is read from the "cards" section using the INFILE statement with a specified delimiter (`,`). The `dsd` option is also used, which stands for "Delimiter-Sensitive Data". This option treats consecutive delimiters as separate, empty fields. In this case, it allows the code to properly handle the data where the delimiter is a comma, and there are no missing values for some variables.
